Event object term is assosiated with events.When a function is associated with event's happening then this function can get a parameter named as event this parameter is basically an object which contains all the information of the event due to which this function is called.For example if we create a button and apply a click event on it and connect it with a function,that when this button is clicked then associated function should be called and then in this function we can receive a parameter 'event'.With the help of this we can do many things.For example each event has some default operations ,mean these default operation will happen every time whenever this event will happen ,but if we want to prevent our code from this default action of event then we can stop by passing event object as an argument and writing at top 'event.preventDefault
