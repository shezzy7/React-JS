import -> import fileName(we can give any name but fileName suits it so we will name it as our fileName as we render it through this name not by original fileName) from "./fileName.jsx";
default export -> export default fileName(original funcName);

named export -> export {funcName};
we use named export when we have to export multiple function instead of single one in this way -> export {func1,func2...};  
named import -> import {fileName} from "./fileName";
we use named import for a file when have used named export with this file.


Note : In summary,named exports are useful when you want to export multiple values and import them with their specific names,while default exports are handy for exporting a single value and giving it a custom name when importing.The choice b\w two depends on the structure and requirements of your codebase.
