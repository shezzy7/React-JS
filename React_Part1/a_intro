React is a library of JavaScript for creating UI(user interface).
It is very popular library of js.It was created by facebook and still is maintained by facebook.

React is basically a frontend technology which helps us in creating beautifull UIs.
React lets us build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.Components mean our buttons,cards etc.Every elmemnt in react is called a component.So we create components individually and then combine these components to entir screens,pages and apps.
Here components are like functions which perform some operations and return some thing.Here in term of components we use term render instead of call/invoke so we render components and in result they return some data.
A components can be as small as a button and as large as a page.
So whole code in react is written in the form of components.  

Components contain code consists of HTML,CSS and JS.If we see this code then we will be unable to understand it as it is written in a special formate which is known as JSX.In this formate html code is written inside javascript code.So JSX is a way of writing html code inside js code.
