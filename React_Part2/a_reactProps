Props are the information that you pass to JSX tag.
React props are like arguments that we pass to components while rendering them.
For example if we have a page with three boxes, each box contains two things one is title and second one is  description.Then instead of created three components for each box we can create a single components and reuse it for all the three boxes by using props.Here we will create a single component which will display data provided by these props in same way.
If we want to send some integer type data in our props then we send it by closing in a curly braces like {123}


<Product title = "Lamborghini" price = "30000"/> here we are rendering Product by sending props to this component and then using these props here as our components receive them in the form of objects

function Product(props){
    return (
        <div class="prd">
            <h3>{props.title}</h3>
            <h5>{props.price}</h5>
        </div>
    );
}
